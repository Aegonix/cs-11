#? 20.
#? The formula E = mc^2 states that the 
#? equivalent energy (E) can be calculated as the  
#? mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c = about 
#? 3Ã—108 m/s) squared. Write a program that accepts 
#? the mass of an object and determines its energy.

mass = float(input("Enter mass: "))

print("Energy:", mass * (3 * 10**8)**2)
