### This repository contains all the *important* programs that we've done in Computer Science for 11th grade (2024-25).

### All of these programs are written by me (kenz); check the [branches](https://github.com/Aegonix/cs-11/branches) for *his* programs.

### Files are organized by date (MM/DD), and sorted into folders based on:
- **programs done in class**
- **textbook exercises**, (only programming and WAP... questions, not MCQs or objective questions)
- **questions for the CS journal**
- **miscellaneous programs**, (random questions, output tests, etc.)

*The code in this repository is entirely original and not copied from any online sources. However, I am not responsible for any unauthorized copying or misuse of my programs.*
